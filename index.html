    <h1>Meeting #2 Problem Set</h1>
    <p>Thanks for coming to the second CCPC meeting. The website is still under construction, so many of the links do not yet
    work. This week we will start with some easier problems. In the coming weeks we will do harder questions and look into
    getting a team for ICPC, and other competitions.</p>

    <p>Two Sum and Invert Binary Tree are considered easy questions by the LeetCode website, and Permutations is a medium question. </p>
    <p>Near the end of the meeting we will have some people who have completed the problems give their solutions to help anyone that could not figure them out.</p>
