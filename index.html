    <h1>Meeting #4 Problem Set</h1>
    <p>Thanks for coming to the fourth CCPC meeting. The website is still under construction, so many of the links do
        not yet
        work. This week we will mostly focus on <b>Linked List problems</b>. In the coming weeks we will do harder questions and
        look into
        getting a team for ICPC, and other competitions.</p>

    <p>Reverse Linked List and Palindrome Linked List are considered easy questions by the LeetCode website, and Reverse Linked List II is a
        medium question. If you are using Java and use assignment on the node objects of the linked lists, Java will not create a deep copy, but rather just <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/discuss/663741/what-happens-when-you-assign-one-object-to-another-object" target="_blank">point</a> to the same object.</p>
    <p>Near the end of the meeting we will have some people who have completed the problems give their solutions to help
        anyone that could not figure them out.</p>
